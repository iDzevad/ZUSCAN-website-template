# ZUSCAN Website Template
This is only the website template of the network scanner project that I have been working on. You need to add Nmap to your path of your device.

Network Tool Guide:
After logging into the login page, you will end up on the page where the system asks you to put for the IP range you are currently in with your device. It asks you to put it in a the correct format (e.g. 192.168.68.0/24). For beginners you might not know where to find this. 
For windows users:
- Press the window key.
- Type in “cmd” and press enter.
- Type in “ipconfig” and search for “Wireless…”
- Here is where you find your IP address and subnet mask.

After having inputted the correct IP range of your device, you will get to the following page where it asks you to pick one of the IP address. If there are none available, it means you have given the wrong IP range. If you were able to select any of the available IP addresses, it takes some times to load the scan result, this loading time depends on the users device where it is being used on.
